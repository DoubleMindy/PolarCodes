1) Parameters L and D of LIST and STACK decoders works only with powers of 2. reason is integer log of them is calculated.
2) SCS decoder works only with P1 domain
3) D > L, log D < n
4) OPerations count for LLR and MINSUM
5) define for operations counting`
6) optimized SC and SCS decoder only with minsum LLR, Creeaper as well
7) optimized SC decoder without CRC
8) all versions of list and stack does not work without CRC
9) Cut off domain type
10) In stack optimized algorithm, metirc of the better path tends to increase
11) IN creeper algorithm, metric tends to decrease
